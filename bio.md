#Programming Background
One programming project that I have worked on was a web-based project that used a database. This was an outside project that I collaborated on with my mom. We loosely called the application that we were making "What To Wear". It was based on the idea that often it is hard to figure out what to wear in the morning. Our application allowed us to store pieces of clothing, categorize them, and view them together to form outfits.
