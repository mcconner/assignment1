My hobbies include running, swimming, reading, paddleboarding, hiking, and cooking. In general, I enjoy spending as much time outside as I can. I live in California so we have nice weather for most of the year. I love going on hikes and exploring all of the beautiful trails and beaches close to where I live. 

#Programming Background
One programming project that I have worked on was a web-based project that used a database. This was an outside project that I collaborated on with my mom. We loosely called the application that we were making "What To Wear". It was based on the idea that often it is hard to figure out what to wear in the morning. Our application allowed us to store pieces of clothing, categorize them, and view them together to form outfits.

One of my favorite projects in CS162 was the final project. This project required us to make a maze type game, where the user traveled through rooms to accomplish a goal. In my game, the user was the zookeeper at a zoo. The goal of the game was to travel throughout the zoo to find the correct type of food to feed each animal.
